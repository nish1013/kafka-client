# Kafka Client - Node.js TypeScript App

**Kafka Client** is a Node.js application written in TypeScript that demonstrates how to use Apache Kafka while adhering to SOLID principles.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the Kafka Client Node.js TypeScript app.

### Prerequisites

To run this application, you need to have Apache Kafka installed and running on your machine. You can download and install Kafka from the official website: [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd kafka-client
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Configuration

Before running the app, make sure to update the Kafka configuration in `src/kafkaConfig.ts` with your Kafka broker details:

```typescript
// src/kafkaConfig.ts
export const kafkaConfig = {
    brokers :["localhost:9092"], // Replace with your Kafka broker(s) information
    topic: "test-topic", // Replace with your Kafka topic name
    clientId:"kafka-client" // Replace with your Kafka client ID
};
```

### Running the App

To start the application, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the Kafka producer and consumer, demonstrating the interaction between the two.

## Features

- Kafka Producer: Sends messages to a Kafka topic.
- Kafka Consumer: Receives messages from the same Kafka topic.
